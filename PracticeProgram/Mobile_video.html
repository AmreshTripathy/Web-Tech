    <h2>Introducing iPhone 15 Pro | Apple</h2>
    <p>
      The new iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are ready for action. Built
      with aerospace-grade titanium for our lightest, most powerful Pro models
      ever. The new Pro camera system pushes the limits of whatâ€™s possible on a
      smartphone, giving photographers the equivalent of seven pro lenses
      ranging from 13 mm on the Ultra Wide camera to 120 mm on the 5x Telephoto
      camera on iPhone 15 Pro Max. Filmmakers can now record video in ProRes 4K
      at 60 fps directly to an external drive. The addition of a USB-C connector
      brings superfast USB 3 transfer speeds, along with support for pro formats
      that massively improve the workflow between shooting and post-production.
      The new design also includes a customizable Action button for quicker
      access to your favorite feature.* And the A17 Pro chip with a 6-core GPU
      introduces a whole new level of immersive mobile gaming performance. In
      short, the new titanium iPhone 15 Pro is our most powerful photo-taking,
      movie-making, game-playing iPhone ever. Learn more about iPhone 15 Pro and
      iPhone 15 Pro Max:
